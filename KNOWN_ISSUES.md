# TweakScale Companion :: ReStock+ :: Known Issues

* Docking ports, Fairings and Ladders are not supported by this patch.
	+ It is a consistent behaviour with stock parts due to TweakScale known limits (well for docking ports it seems to be a really bad idea)
* CKAN doesn't like the underscore "_" character on identifiers, netkan file was renamed using a dash "-".
	+ Not something to bother you, I wrote this here to remind myself in the future. :)
		- Yeah, I'm gettin gold. :D
